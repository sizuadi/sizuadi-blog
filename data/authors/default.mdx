Hello, visitor! My name is Sizu, formerly known as Adi Siswanto. A passionate full-stack developer with a commitment to crafting solution for web applications. My journey in the world of technology began with a deep curiosity for both front-end and back-end development. My focus right now is learning to develop applications starting from  backend, frontend, mobile development and also building a good infrastructure for the application being developed. 

On this blog, I would like to share articles with English and Bahasa, the articles are about self-thinking, documenting my result of learning programming, and documenting experiences in this abstract life. In my free time, I usually reading book or manga, playing game, and watching anime.
